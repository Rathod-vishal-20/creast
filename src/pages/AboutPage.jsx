        Why did we start Crest ?
        </h2>
        <p className="py-6 w-[520px]">
            We increasingly observed how businesses have come to terms with  stockouts as part of fate and struggle to compete against industry giants  for either retail shelf space or  an e-commerce cart.  We have frequently heard  business owners state – “There’s no point in automating and having a great performance marketing campaign if the product is out of stock or takes too long to reach the customer”. A wise man once said: solve for supply chain, and you’ve solved for your business (we might have made that one up, but it’s true!).</p>
